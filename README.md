## 🔰 Getting started
### 1. Install prerequisites

Ensure you have installed:

* PHP 8.2 or higher *(for example, through [Laragon](https://laragon.org/index.html), [if necessary find how to update PHP here](https://pen-y-fan.github.io/2023/01/15/how-to-update-the-php-version-in-laragon/))*

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

* [Git (for Windows)](https://gitforwindows.org/) - *In the next steps we'll assume you'll use Git Bash as your choice of terminal.*

* MySQL 8.0 or higher

### 2. Download the project and dependencies

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/quizit

- Enter the project directory: `cd quizit`

- Run `composer install` *(to install PHP dependencies)*

- Run `npm install` *(to install JavaScript dependencies needed for building the front-end)*

### 3. Fill the environment file

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

- Fill the following fields in the `.env`:

    - The database credentials for the application, e.g:
        ```
        DB_CONNECTION=mysql
        DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
        DB_PORT=3306
        DB_DATABASE=quizit
        DB_USERNAME=root
        DB_PASSWORD=
        ```

    - The Google Maps API Key (ask another developer for this), e.g:
        ```
        GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        ```

- Generate an application key into `APP_KEY` by running `php artisan key:generate`

### 4. Run the migrations and seed the database

- Create a database named `quizit` for the application

- Run `php artisan migrate --seed` to create the database tables and seed them with data.

### 5. Get ready to run the application

- Run `npm run dev` to build the front-end assets *(leave this terminal running so changes are automatically compiled)*

- Run `php artisan serve` to start the application *(leave this terminal running so the application is served)*

- Open the application in your browser at [`http://127.0.0.1:8000`](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

- Login with any of the credentials found in the [seeder file](database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php)
